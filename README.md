### Identify an area of JS code in the final solution (ttt5) you feel really good about â€“ and indicate why.

I feel good about how I created the winConditions array - I use a mixture of the slice method to figure out the across win conditions, and then use array indices to find what letter is in each position of the array, to evaluate the down and diagonal win condition. I think using the position of the array to define the down and diagonal win condition, although maybe clunkier to read is probably more performant since it is looking for an exact position in an array.
